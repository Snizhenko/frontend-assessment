# Assessment Instructions
 This assessment's main focus is ui/ux/animation because we need a few more of that type of dev on our team.
 
 **Design and Assets**: https://marvelapp.com/b391580/screen/53968974   
 **SVGs**: ```/public/svg``` directory  
 **Animation Movie**: ```/resources/animation.mp4```  
 **Principal Working Prototype**: ```/resources/prototype.app```.   
 *The Principal prototype will only work on Mac and requires the Principal app to be downloaded. https://principleformac.com/ I believe you can download a demo version. If this won't work, the Animation Movie also shows the animation, just not as nicely.*   
 
# Task
 1. Create the HTML, CSS and JS to build out the complete design and animation/interactions from the Marvel App and Animation Example video.  
 2. The site needs to be responsive.  
    1. 100% width columns on mobile.  
    2. Implement any mobile UX tweeks you think would be beneficial. We are leaving moile in your court.  
 3. The navigation and logo...work on these last. If you have time, bonus points. If you have time to make it responsive, even more bonus points.  
 
# Design Assets
1. Open the marvel link https://marvelapp.com/b391580/screen/53968974  
2. Click the "Handoff" button in the bottom left corner
3. You can then hover/click elements to export images and get elements' non-RWD style properties. Again, this site needs to be responsive (RWD)
4. Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto 
 
# Animation Requests
1. Parallax Header Image
2. Hover effect on the buckets and its elements. 

The tech stack is open to you but we are mainly a webpack, scss, babel environment. If you want to use a JS framework, plugins, jQuery...no problem. We use Vue and jQuery but it is in your hands on how you want to approach this. 

We look forward to seeing how you tackle this challenge! Good luck!
